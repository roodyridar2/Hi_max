# Bouncing Ball Flutter App

Welcome to the Bouncing Ball Flutter App repository! This project is designed to calculate and visualize the bouncing behavior of a ball using Flutter. 
It also provides statistical data presented in charts.
This app was developed for a college project to demonstrate physics concepts through interactive animations and statistical analysis.

## Features

1. **Bouncing Ball Simulation:** Visualize the motion of a bouncing ball in a controlled environment.
2. **Statistical Analysis:** Calculate and display statistics related to the ball's behavior, such as bounce height, velocity, and time of flight.
3. **Interactive Charts:** View graphical representations of the ball's motion through charts integrated into the app.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter installed on your machine.
- Basic understanding of physics concepts related to ball motion.
